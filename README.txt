STEPS:

1) INITIAL MAP SETTINGS AND STYLING
  - First, I created an OL3 map with Stamen(toner-lite) base layer.
  - Default OL3 controls were included with some additions like ScaleLine and MousePosition. 
  - Map view is centered on capital of Serbia, Belgrade.  //Irrelevant
  - Map's height and width depends on browser window size - responsive.
  - Controls are custom styled with some OL3 CSS override
  
2) CUSTOM CONTROLS
  
3) DRAW, SELECT, MODIFY INTERACTIONS

4) INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE TRANSACTIONS
